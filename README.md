# Housing_Calculator
This is an exercise from my MIS15 course at California State University Sacramento.
The user enters income, home price, and loan data to find out if a home purchase is affordable or not, based on a payment to income ratio rule.
If the payment is not "affordable" then the program determines the number of roommates the user would have to split the payment with in order to make the house payment affordable.
